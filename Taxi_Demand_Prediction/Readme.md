## Business Problem 

#### Background

In the highly competitive taxi service industry, operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and strategic market positioning are crucial for maintaining and enhancing profitability. As urban populations grow and mobility demands evolve, taxi companies face increasing challenges in managing fleet operations, adjusting pricing dynamically, and meeting fluctuating customer demands efficiently.

#### Problem Statement
Companies seek to optimize taxi fleet management, resource allocation, and customer service by accurately predicting taxi demand based on historical data and key variables such as location coordinates and time. The objective is to leverage data from previous years (January to March 2015) to forecast taxi pickups for the same period in the subsequent year (January to March 2016), ensuring a strategic advantage in operational planning and market responsiveness.

#### Objectives

##### Optimization of Taxi Fleet Management

- Improve the positioning and scheduling of taxis to reduce operational costs and minimize passenger wait times.
- Enhance the utilization rate of the fleet by deploying taxis where and when they are most needed.
Dynamic Pricing Strategy:

- Implement dynamic pricing adjustments during peak demand periods to balance the market, enhance revenue, and manage customer expectations.

##### Resource Allocation and Driver Scheduling:

- Optimize driver schedules based on predictive demand insights, thereby reducing overheads related to underutilized labor and increasing earnings during high-demand periods.

##### Urban Planning and Traffic Contribution:

- Provide data-driven insights to city planners and traffic management authorities to aid in the design of more efficient public transportation systems and traffic congestion mitigation.

##### Customer Service Enhancement:

- Achieve superior customer satisfaction levels by ensuring taxi availability aligns closely with demand, thereby reducing wait times and improving service reliability.
  
##### Innovation and Service Development:

- Utilize predictive insights to identify market trends and develop innovative service offerings such as on-demand carpooling or special event transportation solutions.

##### Competitive Advantage and Market Share:

- Strengthen market positioning by offering timely and dependable services, differentiating our company from competitors, and potentially increasing market share.
  
##### Expected Outcomes:

By addressing these objectives through predictive analytics, companies anticipate not only an improvement in operational efficiencies and financial performance but also a notable enhancement in customer service quality.

## Information on taxis:

### Yellow Taxi: Yellow Medallion Taxicabs

These are the famous NYC yellow taxis that provide transportation exclusively through street-hails. The number of taxicabs is limited by a finite number of medallions issued by the TLC. You access this mode of transportation by standing in the street and hailing an available taxi with your hand. The pickups are not pre-arranged.

### For Hire Vehicles (FHVs)
FHV transportation is accessed by a pre-arrangement with a dispatcher or limo company. These FHVs are not permitted to pick up passengers via street hails, as those rides are not considered pre-arranged.

### Green Taxi: Street Hail Livery (SHL)
The SHL program will allow livery vehicle owners to license and outfit their vehicles with green borough taxi branding, meters, credit card machines, and ultimately the right to accept street hails in addition to pre-arranged rides.
